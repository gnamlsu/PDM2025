<h1>Hello Kitty's Picnic Pickup Project Documentation</h1>

<h2>Project Outline</h2>
<p>“Hello Kitty’s Picnic Pickup” is game built with p5.js, Tone.js, and Arduino hardware. The game features cute custom sprites, soft, cheerful background music, and sound effects. Players collect treats while avoiding obstacles using a button and a potentiometer. Three LEDs display the number of lives the player has.</p>

<h2>Narrative Description</h2>
<p>Players play as Hello Kitty, who is on her way to have a picnic with her friends. As Hello Kitty makes her way through the meadow, players need to pick up as many sweet treats as possible, by pressing the button, while avoiding obstacles, using the potentiometer to move up and down. Different types of treats are worth different points. An apple is worth 10 points, a cookie is worth 20 points, and a cake is worth 30 points. Bumping into an obstacle will make you lose a heart and 10 points. The game speeds up over time and ends when the player loses all their hearts.</p>

<h2>Future Development</h2>
<p>To enhance the quality of the game, generation of treats and obstacles could be developed to not allow overlapping objects. To make the game more difficult, it should not be allowed to pick up treats by simply holding down the button. Players should be restricted to picking up treats by pressing the button at the right timing.</p>
